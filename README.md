# NeuroData_860.053-MUW

Welcome to the ecture of the MUW on Processing and Interpretation of Neuroscience Data
Before our first session, please make sure you have MATLAB installed and ready to use.

# **Step 1: Create a MathWorks Account**

Go to https://www.mathworks.com

Click Sign In → Create Account.

### Important
**Use your University email address** – this is required to access the academic license provided by your institution.

Verify your email and sign in.

# **Step 2: Download MATLAB**

Once logged in, go to the Downloads section.

Choose MATLAB R2025a (or the latest 2025 release).

Follow the on-screen instructions to install MATLAB on your computer.

Windows, macOS, and Linux are all supported.

# **Step 3: Select Toolboxes (Packages)**

You don’t need to install everything!
For this course, please make sure you include the following essential toolboxes during installation (you can always add more later):

✅ Signal Processing Toolbox – for handling time series and neural signals.

✅ Wavelet Toolbox – useful for signal decomposition and spectral analysis (used in advanced examples).

✅ Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox – required for basic statistics and linear modelling.

✅ Curve Fitting Toolbox – for fitting functions to experimental data (e.g., tuning curves, regressions).

✅ Image Processing Toolbox – optional but recommended if you plan to explore calcium imaging data later.
