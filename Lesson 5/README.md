# Lesson 5 — Working with Variables

Processing and Interpretation of Neuroscience Data

## Overview

This module introduces core MATLAB concepts through hands-on mini-exercises tailored to neuroscience data workflows. You’ll create and inspect variables, practice vectorized operations, index and slice arrays, import small datasets, run quick statistics, and make sanity-check plots. You’ll also get a gentle tour of scripts, functions, flow control, and common plotting patterns you’ll reuse throughout the course.

The live script is self-contained: if no data are present, it generates small demo files and tables so you can run everything end-to-end.

## Learning goals

By the end of Module 1 you will be able to:

Explain MATLAB’s “everything is an array” model (scalars, vectors, matrices).

Create, inspect, and manipulate arrays; understand size, length, and numel.

Apply vectorized math and element-wise vs. matrix operations.

Index and slice arrays with ranges, logical masks, and row/column access.

Import/export small datasets (MAT, CSV, Excel) and check basic data health.

Compute quick stats and produce sanity-check plots for time series.

Write simple scripts and functions; use loops and basic if/else.

Organize and save results (tables, figures, MAT files).

## Prerequisites

MATLAB (R2019b or newer recommended). No toolboxes required for core parts.

Very basic command-line familiarity (running sections in Live Editor).

## How to use this module

Open the live script Module_1_LiveScript.mlx in MATLAB.

Use Run Section to execute cells top-to-bottom.

Watch outputs in the Command Window, variables in the Workspace, and files in the Current Folder.

When you see Tasks / Exercises, type your answers directly below the prompts.
